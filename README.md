## My process

- I started looking at the images design trying to define what classes would I need
- After looking some time I started to code the html page define some variables at the CSS stylecheet and Importing the fonts
- I started coding the mobile design trying to make it as responsive as I could (it is my first time coding responsive)
- Finishing the mobile interface, I started creating the desktop interface adapting the mobile interface
- Last thing was adding the active state of some bottons

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This was my first attemp of using CSS, I hate it before this project, but to be honest it wasn't that bad, I even enjoyed making this project, so I learned to love CSS in some way.

- One of the biggest things that I could manage to learn better was flex, it seemed terrible to me before trying to use it, but it wasn't bad at all and it is really useful.

- Other thing that I can manage better than before is how CSS works, because before taking [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfDqFArJnYA) course I couldn't understand CSS at all, but now Im felling more confident with using CSS.

- Now I feel bootstrap it wasn't that powerful if you have a previus design to guide you, code a page is not that bad, and using pure CSS open the posibility to modify a lot of things.


### Continued development

In futures projects I would like to keep learning CSS features and make better looking projects, I would like to learn to use JavaScript and CSS trick to make the page more interactive, if someday I feel confident enough I would like to try a simple game.
